            <p>
              The Department of Biological Sciences and Environmental Studies
              (BSES) offers a 4-year BS Biology degree program with two major
              fields of specialization to choose from, Ecology and Cell Biology.
              Areas of study in Ecology include life forms in terrestrial and
              aquatic ecosystems. The Cell Biology division has recently been
              expanded to include not only studies of life forms<br /><br />
              at cellular level, but also molecular studies of plant, animal and
              microbial life forms The BS Biology curriculum also includes the
              conduct of an undergraduate thesis which provides the students the
              opportunity to perform research work along their chosen field of
              specialization under the guidance of their selected faculty
              adviser.

          <h3>MASTER IN MANAGEMENT</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Today’s world of work is more complex and volatile than it was
              years back. Managerial problems, especially those faced by
              decision-makers at the highest levels of administration, have
              become less structured than they were in the past. Increasingly,
              managers have to deal with more sophisticated technologies, more
              rapidly expanding and contracting markets. In adapting to these
              changes, organizations have become flatter, smaller and more
              flexible in structure, more integrative in approach to
              decision-making, and more global in operation.<br /><br />
              Given the dynamism of our present work environment, it becomes
              imperative for organizational leaders to develop the capability to
              assess a broad spectrum of interrelated issues and to interpret a
              continuous stream of data that are vital to decision-making.<br /><br />
              Decision-makers ought to be humanistic because people are the
              carriers of today’s most important resources (knowledge and
              information), and holistic because managerial problems and issues
              are interrelated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The program aims to hone the following managerial skills and
              competences:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Human skills – ability to lead and motivate</li>
              <li>
                Analytical skills – ability to discern relationships, detect
                dysfunction, identity and evaluate options
              </li>
              <li>
                Integrative skills– ability to perceive the whole picture and
                latticework of interdependencies
              </li>
              <li>
                Innovativeness – ability to develop approaches in applying new
                and continually evolving stock of knowledge and information
              </li>
              <li>
                Proactiveness – the ability to anticipate problems and issues to
                set the tone for change and develop orientation or concern for
                the enhancement of the human condition in the long run

          <h3>PhD BY RESEARCH</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              The PhD by Research program aims to produce graduates who have
              contributed to the body of knowledge in specific fields of study
              or to have provided innovative, theory-based, systematic, and
              practical solutions to the significant concerns of specific
              industries.Graduates will have advanced systematic knowledge and
              skills applied in a highly specialized or complex
              multidisciplinary field of professional work, research, and/or
              further study that require management expertise, innovation, and
              leadership. Graduates will demonstrate an in-depth understanding
              of theories and concepts necessary to advance learning and/or
              professional practice as well as to practice research skills
              providing a critical perspective of the real-world complex issues
              related to a specific field of study.<br /><br />The PhD by
              Research program aims to hone further the research skill of the
              candidate, acquired mostly through experience under the
              professional guidance of specialist(s) in his/her particular area
              of specialization. The program allows the candidate to earn the
              degree through submission, and the successful defense of a
              dissertation, without the usual academic course requirements. The
              program requires the candidate to devote almost his/her entire
              residency to research.
