                            <h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
                            <p ">Republic Act 7889, An Act Creating the University of the Philippines in
                Mindanao, was signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on February 20, 1995. But the vision of having
                a UP in Mindanao however started way before that.<br><br>The UP Alumni Association-Davao Chapter, which
                was established on December 3, 1949, had wanted for more than two decades for the establishment of a UP
                in Mindanao. As early as 1961, the UP Summer School already offered extension courses in Law, Business
                Administration and Education, with the old location of the Davao Central Elementary School as venue.</p>
              <p >On November 24 and 25, 1989, the UPAA Davao Chapter hosted the 12th UP
                Alumni Institute with Senator Vicente Paterno as keynote speaker. UP President Jose Abueva, who attended
                the conference, was confronted with the strong and united voice of about 630 alumni in attendance as
                well as the media and the business sector, all clamoring for a resolution that would promote the
                establishment of a UP in Mindanao in Davao City. The resolution was unanimously approved and adopted by
                the Institute on November 25, 1989. This was submitted to the UPAA National and endorsed to the Board of
                Regents.<br><br>The vision of UP in Mindanao began to materialize when, on the third regular session of
                the House of Representatives on April 30, 1990, 1st District Representative Prospero C. Nograles
                introduced House Bill No. 30358, also known as an “Act to establish the University of the Philippines in
                Mindanao.”<br><br>A public hearing on HB No. 30358 was conducted by Senator Edgardo Angara (then
                Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education) on October 12, 1990 at the Davao Chamber of Commerce,
                Kalakalan Hall. It was sponsored by Representative Nograles and Rodolfo del Rosario of Davao del Norte.
                A strong sentiment for the establishment of a UP in Mindanao pervaded the public hearing. To alleviate
                the strong clamor for a UP in Mindanao, Abueva created instead the UP Consortium System, much like the
                Open University. <br><br>When Abueva’s term ended, President Fidel V. Ramos appointed Emil Q. Javier as
                UP President. President Ramos had previously instructed President Javier to create a fact-finding
                committee composed of Regents Oscar Alfonso, Vice-President for Planning Fortunato dela Peña, Atty.
                Carmelita Yadao-Guno and Prof. Rogelio Cuyno. The committee came to Davao for an ocular inspection of
                University of Southern Philippines (USP) in Bago Oshiro. <br><br>After receiving the committee report,
                Javier did not pursue the plan to convert USP to UP in Mindanao due to the resistance demonstrated by
                the USP faculty and staff. Instead, he opted for congressional action. At the same time, the committee
                also talked with the National Bureau of Plant and Industry director Nerios Roperos for the segregation
                of 204 hectares of the BPI area in Bago Oshiro for the UP in Mindanao campus. The task of pursuing the
                House Bill for UP in Mindanao in Congress was given to Davao City 3rd District Congressman Elias B.
                Lopez, as he was the only UP alumnus among the Davao representatives.<br><br>Republic Act 7889, the bill
                creating UP in Mindanao was finally enacted into law on February 20, 1995. On March 22 of the same year,
                the Board of Regents passed a resolution officially creating the University of the Philippines in
                Mindanao. To emphasize the importance of RA 7889 to the Mindanaoans, a reenactment of the signing was
                held at the Central Bank, Davao City with President Fidel V. Ramos himself in attendance.<br><br>The Lee
                Business Center in J. Luna corner J. dela Cruz Streets and the Casa Mercado Building in Matina served as
                UP in Mindanao’s home from March to September 1995, and from September to January 1996,
                respectively.<br><br>On June 1996, the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Management were
                created. After a year, the CAS was split into the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the
                College of Science and Mathematics. The School of Management was retained.<br><br>On February 20, the
                Oblation was installed in Bago Oshiro during the University’s 3rd Foundation Anniversary. The Board of
                Regents granted full autonomy to UP in Mindanao, on February 26, 1998, making it the sixth constituent
                unit of the UP System. Dean Rogelio V. Cuyno, was elevated and installed as its 1st Chancellor on
                December 11, of the same year.</p>
              <p >The 2nd Chancellor was Ricardo de Ungria, the 3rd Chancellor was Gilda C.
                Rivero, and the 4th Chancellor is Sylvia B. Concepcion. The 5th Chancellor is Larry N. Digal (term:
                March 2019-February 2021).</p>
